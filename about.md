<p><b> Hello! This is  Nate. I have established this blog to share the knowledge and insights I've gained through my work with peers and enthusiasts.<br>
        Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Transformation Engine Cell in <a href="https://hyperconnect.com/">Dabeeo InC</a>. Previously, I've worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern in <a href="https://hyperconnect.com/">Hyperconnect</a> AI Lab.<br> I received a master's degree in the department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Dongguk University, in 2021.<br>
       During my time in the master's program, I researched efficient network compression methods for utilizing CNN in real-time inference.<br>
        Also, I studied video data augmentation strategy for 3D CNN-based approach such as video action recognition task.<br>

Hello! This is Nate. I have established this blog to share practical knowledge, technical insights, and lessons learned through my work with peers and fellow engineers.<br>

Since 2026, I have been working at <a href="https://dabeeo.com/">Dabeeo InC</a> as a Technical Lead (Assistant Team Lead) in Research Center Lab 2, where I lead a team of four engineers while driving 3D reconstruction research and designing end-to-end development pipelines that translate research outcomes into production-ready products.<br>

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at the Transformation Engine Cell in <a href="https://dabeeo.com/">Dabeeo InC</a>, and as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern in <a href="https://hyperconnect.com/">Hyperconnect</a> AI Lab.<br>

I hold a master’s degree in the department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Dongguk University, received in 2021.<br>

Through this blog, I aim to document not only what works, but why it works—especially in complex areas such as 3D reconstruction, large-scale vision pipelines, and research-to-product execution.<br>
